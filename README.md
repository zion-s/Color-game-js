# Color-game-js
A simple game of choosing the right colors created using HTML, CSS and JS.

The game has two difficulty levels:
  - Easy: has 3 color tiles to choose from
  - Hard: has 6 color tiles to choose from
  
Each round generates a random RGB color code and the player has to choose the matching color tile.

The game can be reset and played any number of times, each time generating a new color.
